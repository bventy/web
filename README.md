## What This Is

Bventy is a structured marketplace platform designed to improve how event organizers and service vendors connect. 

This repository contains the interface layer—a Next.js application that provides a calm, deliberate experience for finding vendors, managing quote requests, and finalizng event details.

## Design Principles

- **Gated communication**: Contact details are protected until a quote is explicitly accepted.
- **Structured quote workflow**: A predictable sequence of steps from request to fulfillment.
- **Vendor dignity**: Providing vendors with the context they need to price their services fairly.
- **Contact expiry by design**: Communication channels automatically close when their purpose is fulfilled or a deadline passes.
- **Privacy-first architecture**: Data collection is limited to what is necessary for platform operations.
- **Transparent analytics**: Insights are focused on system health and marketplace trends, not user behavior tracking.

## Marketplace Lifecycle

The system is built around a deliberate lifecycle to maintain clarity and focus:

*   **Discovery**: Organizers find vendors whose work aligns with their event needs.
*   **Request Quote**: Organizers provide specific event parameters to initiate a request.
*   **Vendor Responds**: Vendors evaluate the request and provide a priced proposal.
*   **Organizer Accepts**: If the terms are suitable, the organizer approves the quote.
*   **Contact Unlock**: Secure contact information is revealed to both parties.
*   **Expiry & Archive**: Completed or inactive requests are archived to keep the workspace clean.

## Privacy Approach

We take a deliberate approach to user data.

- **No session replay**: We do not record user screens or mouse movements.
- **No invasive tracking**: We avoid third-party scripts that profile users across the web.
- **Operational analytics only**: We gather data primarily to monitor system stability and platform metrics.
- **Vendor contact never public**: Personal emails and phone numbers are never exposed in profile views.
- **Contact automatically expires**: The system manages the availability of contact data based on the quote's lifecycle.

## Architecture Overview

The platform is composed of several focused layers:

- **Frontend**: A Next.js 15 application managing the user experience.
- **Backend**: A Go service providing the marketplace logic and API.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data and state permanence.
- **R2 Storage**: Secure object storage for attachments and media.
- **Activity Log**: A unified layer for audit trails and platform health.
