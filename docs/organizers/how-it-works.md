# How Bventy Works for Organizers

Bventy provides a clean, focused interface for organizers to find and collaborate with vendors. Our goal is to ensure you have clear, comparable proposals before you share your contact information.

## The Organizer's Workflow

### 1. Vendor Discovery 
Browse the marketplace to find vendors whose portfolio and style align with your event vision.

### 2. Requesting a Quote 
Initiate a request by providing your event's details through our guided form. We help you provide the context vendors need to be accurate.

### 3. Reviewing Proposals 
Vendor responses are collected in one dashboard. You can compare pricing and terms without the clutter of a messy inbox.

### 4. Refining Requirements 
If a proposal needs adjustment, you can request a revision directly through the platform. This keeps communications professional and documented.

### 5. Finalizing the Connection 
Once you are satisfied with a proposal, you accept it. This reveals the vendor's secure contact details so you can move forward with confidence.

## Why This Matters

By managing interactions through the platform, we protect your privacy and ensure that every connection you make is based on a clear, mutual understanding of terms.
