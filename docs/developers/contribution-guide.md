# Contribution Guide

Bventy is a collaborative project. We value contributions that improve the platform's reliability, privacy, and user experience.

## Standards

- **Code Clarity**: Write code that is easy for others to understand. We prioritize clarity over cleverness.
- **Component Integrity**: Ensure new components are accessible and follow our established design patterns.
- **Full Transparency**: Any change affecting data handling or privacy must be documented clearly in the relevant `/docs` file.
- **TypeScript**: All new code must be fully typed. Avoid the use of `any`.

## Process

1.  **Search**: Check if an issue or PR already exists for what you're working on.
2.  **Discuss**: For large changes, start a discussion in an issue before writing code.
3.  **Branch**: Work in a descriptive feature branch.
4.  **Review**: Submit a Pull Request. Expect thoughtful feedback and be prepared to iterate.

## Documentation Expectations

We use a calm, human-first tone. Avoid marketing language, hype, or unnecessary complexity. Documentation should feel deliberate and helpful.
