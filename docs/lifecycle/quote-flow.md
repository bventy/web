# Quote Workflow

Bventy's interface is built around a structured quote workflow to ensure that interactions between organizers and vendors are clear and professional.

## The Interaction Design

### 1. Request Initiation
Organizers use a guided form to provide event details. This structured input helps vendors understand the scope without back-and-forth questioning.

### 2. Proposal Presentation
Vendor responses are presented in a unified dashboard. Organizers can view pricing and terms side-by-side to make informed decisions.

### 3. Deliberate Revisions
The Revision Request feature allows organizers to provide feedback without leaving the platform's structured environment. Vendors receive clear notifications about what needs adjustment.

### 4. Acceptance and Unlocking
When a quote is accepted, the UI transition is significant. The vendor's contact details (email, phone) are revealed, transitioning the relationship from the platform's broker state to a direct collaboration state.

## UX Principles

- **Predictability**: Users always know the current state of their interaction and what the next step is.
- **Clarity**: High-stakes actions, like accepting a quote, are clearly marked and verified.
- **Low Pressure**: The gated nature of communication reduces the stress often associated with marketplace negotiations.
