# Contact Visibility and Expiry

Protecting private contact information is a core feature of the Bventy user experience.

## Visibility Patterns

- **Gated State**: By default, vendor contact information is hidden in profiles and quote listings. The UI displays placeholders or clear messaging about when this data will be available.
- **Unlocked State**: Upon quote acceptance, contact details are rendered in a highlighted "Contact Info" section within the quote detail view.

## Automated Revocation

Access to contact information is time-limited.
- **Expiry Feedback**: The UI informs users of the remaining window of access.
- **Archive State**: Once a quote is archived or the expiry period passes, the contact details are removed from the view, and the interaction returns to a protected historical record.

## Privacy Benefits

- **Reduced Exposure**: Personal identifiers are only revealed to verified participants during the active phase of an engagement.
- **SPAM Prevention**: By managing visibility through the platform, we prevent contact harvesting and protect the privacy of our vendors and organizers.
