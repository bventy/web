# How Bventy Works for Vendors

Bventy is designed to protect your professional time and ensure you have the context you need to provide accurate, competitive quotes.

## The Vendor's Workflow

### 1. Receiving Requests 
When an organizer identifies you as a potential fit, you'll receive a structured request with all the necessary event parameters. 

### 2. Crafting Proposals 
Submit your proposal directly through the platform. Your contact details remain protected during this stage, preventing unsolicited inquiries.

### 3. Managing Revisions 
If an organizer asks for changes, you can update your proposal directly. This keeps the agreement clear and documented without leaving the platform.

### 4. Booking the Event 
Once an organizer accepts your quote, their contact information is revealed to you. You can then proceed with your standard contract and fulfillment process.

### 5. Professional Stewardship 
Bventy helps you maintain a high standard of professional communication, ensuring that every booking starts with clarity and respect.

## Our Commitment to You

Bventy is built to uphold vendor dignity. We ensure that you are only communicating with serious organizers who value your professional service and transparent pricing.
