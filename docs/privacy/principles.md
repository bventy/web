# Privacy Principles

Privacy in Bventy is not a feature; it is a foundational architectural choice. On the frontend, this means providing an interface that respects user boundaries and data autonomy.

## Core Principles

### Interface Minimality
We only request the information required to facilitate professional connections. We avoid "dark patterns" that encourage users to overshare personal details.

### Transparent Data Exposure
The state of your data—whether it is public, gated, or unlocked—is always clearly indicated. Users are never surprised by who can see their information.

### No Passive Surveillance
We avoid scripts and tracking mechanisms that monitor user behavior without an explicit operational purpose. We do not use session replay or heatmapping tools.

### Clarity by Design
This documentation is part of our commitment to transparency. We believe users should understand how their interaction with the frontend affects their data privacy.
